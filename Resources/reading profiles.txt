Steps to determining which objects are part of a profile:

1. Resolve each bank defined by the profile. Keep the indexes in a list, and don't resolve any banks that are already in the list.
2. If base is set, for each space delimited value:
	2a. Find the profile with that ID and go to step 1.

How to resolve a bank:

1. If the bank has children, treat each src attribute as if it were a bank definition.
2. Otherwise, if the bank has an objects attribute, add each space delimited range of files to the object list.
3. Otherwise, add all files of the form ObjectX.png to the object list.
